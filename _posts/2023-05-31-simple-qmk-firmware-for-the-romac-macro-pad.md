QMK firmware for the RoMac macro pad was not *simple enough*
for me, so I had to make my own.

{% assign media = site.baseurl | append: "/assets/media/" | append:  page.path | replace: ".md","" | replace: "_posts/",""  %}

The [RoMac Macro Pad](https://github.com/The-Royal/The_Royal_Open-Source-Projects/blob/master/01%20-%20Complete%20Kits/The_RoMac_rev2.1/README.md)
is a wonderful, very useful 12-key macro pad that can be a
custom numpad or, better yet, an *additional* numpad for the
left hand, just not for numbers.
This macro pad, which can be purchased from
[customkbd.com](https://customkbd.com/collections/numpad-and-macropad/products/romac-2-1)
(Australia) or
[mechboards.co.uk](https://mechboards.co.uk/collections/kits/products/romac-macro-pad?variant=40366789034189)
(United Kingdom), the latter also having
[Relegendable Keycaps](https://mechboards.co.uk/collections/keycaps/products/mx-relegendable-keycap)
that are great to custom-label each key.

**Warning: this is not a keyboard you can *just buy***.
To build this keyboard you need to buy [the kit](https://mechboards.co.uk/collections/kits/products/romac-macro-pad?variant=40366789034189),
*with* a controller (e.g. the
[Pro Micro](https://mechboards.co.uk/collections/controllers/products/pro-micro-5v)),
*plus* **20 switches** *and* **20 keycaps**, *plus* a USB
cable (micro-B or C depending on the controller).
*And then* you have to *actually build* the keyboard,
following the (very detailed)
[RoMac rev2.1 Build Guide](https://imgur.com/a/l24vgvC),
which involves *a lot* of soldering.
There is [another build guide](https://imgur.com/a/rjeD0Pn)
for the [Fauxmac (RoMac+)](https://mechboards.co.uk/collections/kits/products/romac-macro-pad?variant=41666504753357)
variant (with OLED screen and RGB backlight).

*And then* you have to choose, or write, a keymap for it.

Although not included in the upstream
[QMK firmware](https://github.com/qmk/qmk_firmware/tree/master/keyboards/kingly_keys/romac#romac),
my preferred use for this keyboard is adding back the
[F13-F24 keys](https://dev.to/grahamthedev/did-you-know-there-are-f13-f24-keys-368p)
some old keyboards used to have. This is *very* useful to
trigger actions or scripts by pressiong **a single key**
without taking the right hand away from the mouse.

So here is how to create the simplest keymap: F13-F24 keys.

First, clone the
[QMK firmware](https://github.com/qmk/qmk_firmware)
repository:

```
$ python3 -m pip install -U qmk
$ git clone --recurse-submodules \
  https://github.com/qmk/qmk_firmware.git
$ cd qmk_firmware
$ qmk setup -y
```

Then create a new file (and folder)
`keyboards/kingly_keys/romac/keymaps/simple/keymap.c`
with this code:

#include QMK_KEYBOARD_H

#define _BASE 0
#define _FN1 1

const uint16_t PROGMEM keymaps[][MATRIX_ROWS][MATRIX_COLS] = {

        [_BASE] = LAYOUT(
                KC_F13, KC_F14, KC_F15, \
                KC_F16, KC_F17, KC_F18, \
                KC_F19, KC_F20, KC_F21, \
                KC_F22, KC_F23, KC_F24 \
        )
};
```

Finally, compile and *flash* the keymap into the keyboard.

**Note:** `qmk flash` won't work unless the keyboard is
plugged in and you may need to press the reset button
(the tiny black button on the PCB) at the right time:

```
$ qmk compile -kb kingly_keys/romac -km simple
$ qmk flash -kb kingly_keys/romac -km simple
Î¨ Compiling keymap with make --jobs=1 kingly_keys/romac:simple:flash

```

Now the keyboard is ready to emit the keycodes for the
function keys from F13 to F24, but those keycodes may be
already assigned by your OS to something else.

In Linux systems, Xorg assigns a few of these keycodes to
vendor-specific keys found in laptops (e.g. mute mic).
To override these, add the following lines to your
`~/.Xmodmap` file:

```
keycode 191 = F13 F13 F13
keycode 192 = F14 F14 F14
keycode 193 = F15 F15 F15
keycode 194 = F16 F16 F16
keycode 195 = F17 F17 F17
keycode 196 = F18 F18 F18
keycode 197 = F19 F19 F19
keycode 198 = F20 F20 F20
keycode 199 = F21 F21 F21
keycode 200 = F22 F22 F22
keycode 201 = F23 F23 F23
keycode 202 = F24 F24 F24
```

What you do with these is now up to you, and depends on your
OS and desktop environments. For instance, in KDE Plasma you
can assign these to standard
[Keyboard Shortcuts](https://docs.kde.org/stable5/en/khelpcenter/fundamentals/shortcuts.html)
or create more flexible (powerful)
[Custom Shortcuts](https://docs.kde.org/stable5/en/khotkeys/kcontrol/khotkeys/khotkeys.pdf).
