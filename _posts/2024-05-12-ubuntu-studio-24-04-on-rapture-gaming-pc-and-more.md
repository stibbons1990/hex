Installing Ubuntu Studio 24.04 on my main PC, for Gaming, coding, media and more."

## Considering Timing

[Ubuntu Studio 24.04 LTS Released](https://ubuntustudio.org/2024/04/ubuntu-studio-24-04-lts-released/)
on April 25 but, as they themselves put it
*since itâ€™s just out, you may experience some issues, so you might want to wait a bit before upgrading*.

There doesn't seem to be anything particular scarey in release notes:

*  [Ubuntu Studio 24.04 LTS Release Notes](https://ubuntustudio.org/ubuntu-studio-24-04-LTS-release-notes/)
*  [Kubuntu 24.04 Release Notes](https://wiki.ubuntu.com/NobleNumbat/ReleaseNotes/Kubuntu)
*  [Noble Numbat Release Notes](https://discourse.ubuntu.com/t/noble-numbat-release-notes/39890/1)

And my plan is not to upgrade in place; I like to keep the previous
version around just in case I need a stable system to fall back to.

## Preparation

In preparation to upgrade my main PC to
[**Ubuntu Studio**](https://ubuntustudio.org/) **24.04**,
I installed a new
[Kingston FURY Renegade 4000 GB M.2 SSD](https://www.kingston.com/en/ssd/gaming/kingston-fury-renegade-nvme-m2-ssd)
and prepared partitions as follows:

1. 260 MB EFI System for the EFI boot.
2. 75 GB Linux filesystem for the root (ext4).
3. 75 GB Linux filesystem for the alternative root (ext4).
4. 3.5T GB Linux filesystem for `/home` (btrfs).

**Note:** 75 GB has proven to be a reasonable size for the
root partition for the amount of software that tends to be
installed in my PC, including 20 GB in `/usr` and 13 GB in
`/snap`.

### Partitions

First,
[create a GPT partition table](https://serverfault.com/a/709952)
(`label`), then create
the partitions
[with `optimal` alignment](https://unix.stackexchange.com/a/49274)

```
# parted /dev/nvme1n1 --script -- mklabel gpt
# parted -a optimal /dev/nvme1n1 mkpart primary fat32 0% 260MiB
# parted -a optimal /dev/nvme1n1 mkpart primary ext4 260MiB 75GiB
# parted -a optimal /dev/nvme1n1 mkpart primary ext4 75GiB 150GiB
# parted -a optimal /dev/nvme1n1 mkpart primary btrfs 150GiB 100%

# parted /dev/nvme1n1 print

Disk /dev/nvme1n1: 4001GB
Sector size (logical/physical): 512B/512B
Partition Table: gpt
Disk Flags:

/dev/nvme1n1p4 314572800 7814035455 7499462656  3.5T Linux filesystem
```

Partitions can be created during the installation of the
system, there is no need to create them before hand because
the previous M.2 SSD is not going anywhere any time soon.

In the future, the previous (2 TB) M.2 SSD may be replaced with another 4 TB SSD, e.g.
- [Kingston FURY Renegade with Heatsink](https://www.digitec.ch/en/s1/product/kingston-fury-renegade-with-heatsink-4000-gb-m2-2280-ssd-22903765) ($320+)
- [Samsung 990 Pro with Heatsink](https://www.digitec.ch/en/s1/product/samsung-990-pro-with-heatsink-4000-gb-m2-2280-ssd-37728060) ($300+)

However, that replacement will likely not happen under 2026,
once Ubuntu Studio 26.04 is installed and there is no longer
a point to keep the old Ubuntu 22.04 around.

In the meantime, the new SSD can be converted into being the new
`/home` and, while the old one is still around, this could be a
good time to try [bcachefs](https://bcachefs.org/) on the new one.
However, that requires either [building a kernel](https://kernelnewbies.org/KernelBuild)
or waiting for Linux **6.7** or later.
[Ubuntu 24.04 LTS Will Aim To Ship With The Linux 6.8 Kernel](https://www.phoronix.com/news/Ubuntu-24.04-Will-Use-Linux-6.8),
so the easier approach would be to wait for the installation of Ubuntu 24.04
to move `/home` to the new SSD.

Listen to [Linux Matters #23: An Exodus of Bitcoin](https://linuxmatters.sh/23/)
were *Martin has excitedly installed it on everything!*
In particular, there seems to be options to configure large
file systems across multiple devices **with redundancy**
(details to be confirmed) and *tiered storage* to keep
*hot data* on the faster storage (NVME) and rebalance unused
data back to slower storage (SATA).

### New BtrFS Home

Create a new `btrfs` file system to test the new SSD, while
we're waiting for the upcoming Ubuntu 24.04 release:

```
# mkfs.btrfs /dev/nvme1n1p4
btrfs-progs v5.16.2
See http://btrfs.wiki.kernel.org for more information.

```

Suddently there is a lot of space available!

```
$ df -h

/dev/nvme1n1p4  3.5T  3.7M  3.5T   1% /home/new-m2
```

### Transfer Speed Test

First, transfer 1.4 GB of media (family photos and videos)
from the SATA SSD. Theoretical maximum transfer speed is
around 550 MB/s, but in practice the transfer speed fluctuates
between 500 and 540 MB/s and the transfer took 48 minutes.
There was little difference between using `rync -uva` vs
`cp -av`.

```
# time cp -a /home/ssd/Fotos /home/new-m2/

real    48m39.874s
user    0m3.933s
sys     13m10.019s
```

Then, transfer 1.1 GB of personal files from the old
NVME SSD. Theoretical maximum transfer speed is
around 3000 MB/s, in practice the transfer speed fluctuates
between 800 and 2500 MB/s and the transfer took 25 minutes,
so just about twice as fast as the previous one.

```
# time rsync -a /home/coder /home/new-m2/

real    24m54.444s
user    4m31.149s
sys     17m54.582s
```

With these 2 transfers, the new M.2 SSD is nearly at 70%:

```
$ df -h
Filesystem      Size  Used Avail Use% Mounted on
/dev/nvme0n1p5  1.7T  1.2T  517G  70% /home
/dev/sdc        3.7T  2.7T  1.1T  72% /home/ssd
/dev/sda        5.5T  5.3T  254G  96% /home/raid
/dev/sdb        3.7T  3.0T  667G  83% /home/new-ssd
/dev/nvme1n1p4  3.5T  2.4T  1.2T  69% /home/new-m2
```
