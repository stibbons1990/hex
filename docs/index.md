# *What's It All About?*

This site is mostly a rambling journal about [Unexpected Linux Adventures](blog/index.md),
potentially wahooney-shapped Raspberry Pies and some other stuff along the way.

Sometimes, some of the stuff coalesces into something *somewhat useful*.
Sometimes, after some time refining it so that it works more than it sucks,
it may end up among the [Projects](projects/index.md).
