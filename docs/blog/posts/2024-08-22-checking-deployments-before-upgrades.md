title: Checking deployments before upgrading kubeadm clusters
---

I've been meaning to upgrade Kubernetes ever since 
[*Kubernetes Certificate Expired*](2024-03-22-kubectl-certificate-expired.md)
about a year after setting up the
[Kubernetes cluster in lexicon](2023-03-25-single-node-kubernetes-cluster-on-ubuntu-server-lexicon.md).

<!-- more -->

[Upgrading kubeadm clusters](https://v1-27.docs.kubernetes.io/docs/tasks/administer-cluster/kubeadm/kubeadm-upgrade/)
is a bit of an involved process and a little intimidating at first,
so it pays to use the tools available to anticipate problems with API
deprecations from one Kubernetes version to the next.

## Install Go

Several of the following tools require Go and in some cases a fairly
recent version, e.g. [`kubeconform`](#kubeconform) requires v1.22.
Ubuntu Server 22.04 packages only provide v1.18, to install newer
versions use `snap` instead:

``` console
# snap install --classic --channel=latest/stable go
go 1.23.0 from Canonicalâœ“ installed
```

For convenience, add `~/go/bin/` to your `PATH`.

## Kubepug

[Deprecations AKA KubePug - Pre UpGrade (Checker)](https://github.com/kubepug/kubepug?tab=readme-ov-file#deprecations--aka-kubepug---pre-upgrade-checker)
is one of the simplest tools to use.

``` console
$ go install github.com/kubepug/kubepug@latest

$ kubepug 2>/dev/null \
  --k8s-version=v1.27 \
  --input-file ~/src/lexicon-deployments/

No deprecated or deleted APIs found

Kubepug validates the APIs using Kubernetes markers. To know what are the deprecated and deleted APIS it checks, please go to https://kubepug.xyz/status/

$ kubepug 2>/dev/null \
  --k8s-version=v1.27 \
  --input-file ~/src/kubernetes-deployments/

No deprecated or deleted APIs found

Kubepug validates the APIs using Kubernetes markers. To know what are the deprecated and deleted APIS it checks, please go to https://kubepug.xyz/status/
```

Same with `--k8s-version=v1.32`.

## Kubent

[kube-no-trouble](https://github.com/doitintl/kube-no-trouble)

``` console
# sh -c "$(curl -sSL https://git.io/install-kubent)"
>>> kubent installation script <<<
> Detecting latest version
> Downloading version 0.7.3
  % Total    % Received % Xferd  Average Speed   Time    Time     Time  Current

> Done. kubent was installed to /usr/local/bin/.
```

To check the running environment:

``` console
$ kubent -t 1.27 
12:29AM INF >>> Kube No Trouble `kubent` <<<
12:29AM INF version 0.7.3 (git sha 57480c07b3f91238f12a35d0ec88d9368aae99aa)
12:29AM INF Initializing collectors and retrieving data
12:29AM INF Target K8s version is 1.27.0
12:29AM INF Retrieved 41 resources from collector name=Cluster
12:29AM INF Retrieved 0 resources from collector name="Helm v3"
12:29AM INF Loaded ruleset name=custom.rego.tmpl
12:29AM INF Loaded ruleset name=deprecated-1-16.rego
12:29AM INF Loaded ruleset name=deprecated-1-22.rego
12:29AM INF Loaded ruleset name=deprecated-1-25.rego
12:29AM INF Loaded ruleset name=deprecated-1-26.rego
12:29AM INF Loaded ruleset name=deprecated-1-27.rego
12:29AM INF Loaded ruleset name=deprecated-1-29.rego
12:29AM INF Loaded ruleset name=deprecated-1-32.rego
12:29AM INF Loaded ruleset name=deprecated-future.rego
```

To check manifest files:

``` console
$ kubent -t 1.27 $(find -name "*.yaml")
12:34AM INF >>> Kube No Trouble `kubent` <<<
12:34AM INF version 0.7.3 (git sha 57480c07b3f91238f12a35d0ec88d9368aae99aa)
12:34AM INF Initializing collectors and retrieving data
12:34AM INF Target K8s version is 1.27.0
12:34AM INF Retrieved 41 resources from collector name=Cluster
12:34AM INF Retrieved 0 resources from collector name="Helm v3"
12:34AM INF Loaded ruleset name=custom.rego.tmpl
12:34AM INF Loaded ruleset name=deprecated-1-16.rego
12:34AM INF Loaded ruleset name=deprecated-1-22.rego
12:34AM INF Loaded ruleset name=deprecated-1-25.rego
12:34AM INF Loaded ruleset name=deprecated-1-26.rego
12:34AM INF Loaded ruleset name=deprecated-1-27.rego
12:34AM INF Loaded ruleset name=deprecated-1-29.rego
12:34AM INF Loaded ruleset name=deprecated-1-32.rego
12:34AM INF Loaded ruleset name=deprecated-future.rego
```

Same in `kubernetes-deployments` and `lexicon-deployments`,
with `-t 1.27` and `-t 1.32`.

## kubeconform

[kubeconform](https://github.com/yannh/kubeconform) seems to show the
opposite picture: errors are found even for the currently running
Kubernetes version, which is running all these deployments just fine.

``` console
$ go install github.com/yannh/kubeconform/cmd/kubeconform@latest

Even if the above errors can be safely ignored, many more are returned
when running with a higher target version, e.g. 1.32:
