title: xHCI host controller not responding, assume dead
---

Today, a number of USB devices were unavailable for no apparent reason.
 
Having a terminal always visible running `dmesg -w` the following showed up:

```
xhci_hcd 0000:0b:00.3: Abort failed to stop command ring: -110
xhci_hcd 0000:0b:00.3: xHCI host controller not responding, assume dead
xhci_hcd 0000:0b:00.3: HC died; cleaning up
```

Hmm, *assume dead...* that doesnâ€™t sounds good.

Searching for posts about these error messages,
the best match that showed up was 
[techoverflow.net/2021/09/16/how-i-fixed-xhci-host-controller-not-responding-assume-dead](https://techoverflow.net/2021/09/16/how-i-fixed-xhci-host-controller-not-responding-assume-dead/)
which summarizes the discussion and findings from this thread in the
ArchLinux forums:
[xHCI host controller not responding, assume dead](https://bbs.archlinux.org/viewtopic.php?pid=1855486#p1855486).

The solution provided there worked in this case too, without even waiting for 5 seconds between the unbind and bind commands:

``` console
echo -n 0000:0b:00.3 > /sys/bus/pci/drivers/xhci_hcd/unbind
echo -n 0000:0b:00.3 > /sys/bus/pci/drivers/xhci_hcd/bind
```

After restarting this controller a few times, it was never again problematic.

Created script for future use and reference:

``` bash linenums="1" title="restart-usb.sh"
#!/bin/bash

id=$1
echo -n "$id" > /sys/bus/pci/drivers/xhci_hcd/unbind
sleep 1

```

#### Update (2023-12-09)

The same, or similar, problem happened again when leaving
the computer running overnight while most devices powered
off. What is most strange is that the problem seems to
have started when (be triggered by?) powering most USB
devices *off*:
