# Projects

Stuff that coalesced into something *somewhat useful*:

*   [Continuous Monitoring](conmon.md) is a small collection of ad-hoc
    Bash and Python scripts to collect monitoring metrics and push them
    to an InfluxDB 1.x server.
*   [Self-hosting](self-hosting.md) is an ever-changing summary of all
    the applications I host and manage, or used or, or tried to, or
    would like to, maybe some day, on my own server(s).
